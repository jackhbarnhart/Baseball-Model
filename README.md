# Baseball-Model
Simulate a full MLB season based on batting statistics from the 2020 season

I initiated this project to learn the basics of Python and produce a simplified baseball model for my own entertainment. The model is capable of simulating a game,
season, or playoffs based on batting stats housed in an excel file. The model looks at players relative % chance to hit a 1B, 2B, 3B, HR, K, or BB. Pitching is not a
factor in the model; the purpose of this project was to learn Python rather than create the most accurate baseball model possible.
