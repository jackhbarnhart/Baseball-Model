# Baseball-Model
Simulate a full MLB season based on batting statistics from the 2020 season

I initiated this project to learn the basics of Python and produce a simplified baseball model for my own entertainment. The model is capable of simulating a game, season, or playoffs based on 2020 MLB batting stats. Additionally, excel integration was a key learning point for this project. The model uses players' relative % chance to hit a 1B, 2B, 3B, HR, K, or BB to run its simulation. Pitching is not a factor in the model; the purpose of this project was to learn Python and identify undervalued players rather than create the most accurate baseball model possible.
